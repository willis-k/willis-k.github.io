	<h1>WK</h1>
	<p>My name is Willis Kim and this is my personal website - built using Jekyll static site generator, 
		hosted on github pages, and connected to my domain. I apologize if the site is a bit plain. 
		I decided against using a template in order to focus on learning rather than an end result. As such, 
		this website will always reflect my current ability accurately, no short-cuts or half-measures.
