	<h1>WK</h1>
	<p>My name is Willis Kim and this is my personal website. 
		
	<p>It's built using Jekyll (static site generator) and 
		hosted on github pages connected to a custom domain. 
		
	<p>I apologize if the site is a bit plain. 
		I decided against using a template in order to learn and improve as I go. As such, 
		this website will always reflect my current ability accurately, no short-cuts.
